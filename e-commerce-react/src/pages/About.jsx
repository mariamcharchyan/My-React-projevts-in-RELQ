        MAJOURI was created in Paris in 2017 by Hadi Masmoum. Native of the
        Orient and bathed since his childhood in the world of perfumery, he
        launched MAJOURI to make heritage modern. Hadi Masmoum has a passion for
        the South of France where, in Grasse, he studied perfumery. He fell in
        love with the light there—a light common across the Mediterranean basin
        that cultivates both the Rose de Grasse and the Damask Rose of his
        origins. The name MAJOURI is a homage to these shared experiences,
        blending ‘Maa’ the word for water in Arabic, and ‘Jouri’ meaning Damask
        Rose. MAJOURI is an olfactive encounter, where passion meets
        perspective, and past meets future.
